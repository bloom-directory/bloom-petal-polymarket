//! The onboarding state machine — deploy → fund → approve → creds → sync.
//!
//! [`Onboarder::run`] drives a wallet through every incomplete onboarding
//! stage, **idempotently and resumably**: each stage probes real state (chain
//! code/balances/allowances, the creds file) before acting, so the persisted
//! [`OnboardState`] is a progress hint for humans, never the authority — a
//! daemon killed mid-run self-heals on the next run. State is persisted to
//! `<dir>/<wallet>/account.json` (no secrets) after every transition, and any
//! error is recorded in `last_error` before returning so a fire-and-forget
//! caller (the VFS `begin` write spawns this) always leaves an observable
//! trail.
//!
//! Side effects that move past the relayer or mint credentials are reported
//! through the [`OnboardEvent`] callback so the caller can append audit
//! records; events carry tx ids and the API-key id only — never the L2
//! `secret`/`passphrase`.
//!
//! Chain reads go through the narrow [`ChainReader`] trait so this crate stays
//! free of any RPC/client coupling (the daemon adapts its chain client; tests
//! use a mock).
